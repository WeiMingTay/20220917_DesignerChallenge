					Every idea <span><img src="assets/img/Lev3_2_Project_css-vertiefung_designer-challenge/idea.png" alt="light idea" /></span> starts with a
					need
				</h4>
				<p>
					Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could
					improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start
					designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and
					stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge,
					something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many
					designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I
					really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just
					something nice and did not solve any problem.

                            <h5>Start with asking why</h5>
                            <p>You will start seeing things differently and coming up with
                                more effective ways of achieving goals.

							By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas

                                Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the
                                frustration of the users and resolve to end it.
                            </p>

                                As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not
                                finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept
                                feedback and learn from it.
                            </p>

						<h6>Find your problem</h6>

						<h6>Think about the solution</h6>
						<p>

						<h6>Design your proposal</h6>
						<p>
							How can design help solve your problem? It's time to think about
